<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p>Draft</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This library describe a mechanism known as hooks. A certain kind of extension point in a program that allows interleaving the execution of arbitrary code with the execution of a program without introducing any coupling between the two.</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>The use of hooks is pervasive in emacs and many other programs that offer some “plugins” mechanism that are built on top a facility similar to what this library offers.</p>
<p>While building programs there is a need to offer extension points to allow the user to extends and customize the execution of the program in way that avoids coupling. This library want to help with that.</p>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>This specification describe one disjoint type called <code>hook</code>.</p>
<h3 id="make-hook-arity"><code>(make-hook arity)</code></h3>
<p>Create a <code>hook</code> object for storing procedures of <code>ARITY</code>. The returned value is a <code>hook</code> object.</p>
<h3 id="hook-obj"><code>(hook? obj)</code></h3>
<p>Return <code>#t</code> if <code>obj</code> is a hook. Otherwise it returns <code>#f</code>.</p>
<h3 id="hook-add-hook-proc"><code>(hook-add! hook proc)</code></h3>
<p>Add the procedure <code>PROC</code> to the <code>HOOK</code> object. The return value is not specified. An implementation may check the arity of <code>PROC</code> to be equal to the arity of the <code>HOOK</code>.</p>
<h3 id="hook-delete-hook-proc"><code>(hook-delete! hook proc)</code></h3>
<p>Delete the procedure <code>PROC</code> from the <code>HOOK</code> object. The return value is not specified.</p>
<h3 id="hook-reset-hook"><code>(hook-reset! hook)</code></h3>
<p>Remove all procedures from the <code>HOOK</code> object. The return value is not specified.</p>
<h3 id="hook-list-hook"><code>(hook-&gt;list hook)</code></h3>
<p>Convert the list of procedures of <code>HOOK</code> object to a list.</p>
<h3 id="hook-run-hook-.-args"><code>(hook-run hook . args)</code></h3>
<p>Apply all procedures from <code>HOOK</code> to the arguments <code>ARGS</code>. The order of the procedure application is not specified. The return value is not specified. The length of <code>ARGS</code> must be equal to the arity of the <code>HOOK</code> object.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>TBD</p>
